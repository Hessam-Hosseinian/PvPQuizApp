Let's say this is a quiz site
Next I will tell you what you need to implement

First of all, the registration and login pages
Then I want the profile page, on this page all the user information will be displayed and there will also be a page for editing their information
On this page I want the admin panel to be displayed depending on whether the user is an admin or not. Design the admin panel as well

Design a page for the leaderboard
A page to display the categories
A page to start the game
There are two types of games
A type of head-to-head game where the player enters the waiting line after pressing the start button and enters the game after the opponent is found
Then, one by one, by choosing a category from the three suggested categories, the category of questions for each round is determined. After all the rounds are over, the winner should be displayed.

In all moments I want the points to be equal

The second type of game is a group game that is multiplayer and has ten rounds, each round has a category
Create the main page with your own creativity
In all pages, check the implementation details by reading the files I sent you

I want your designs to be minimal and beautiful and use the basic colors red and blue

Do your best
